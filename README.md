# AREA 742

For our course project for CMPT 742 at SFU, we built a virtual reality (VR) survival game depicting the adverse effects of climate change on the environment, especially on wildlife. The game depicts exaggerated and accelerated patterns of global warming and pollution through in-game mechanics as the player traverses the map looking for shelter. It is built for the Oculus Go VR headset using Unity. <br /><br />
The player experiences the world as a penguin in its ever- dwindling habitat. The player has a first-person view of the surroundings, rendered in VR. This allows the player to experience the harsh and dangerous environment first hand. <br /><br />
The world consists of an icy island (comparable to a miniature Antarctica). The island is in the middle of the ocean, but since the environment is extremely polluted, the effects of global warming are significant and water levels are slowly but steadily rising. <br /><br />
Additionally, due to pollution levels, many parts of the world are toxic and must be avoided. This is represented by a shrinking safe zone, which the player must remain inside to prevent being poisoned. In-game, this translates to a steadily changing world: <br />
• Initially, the player is just starting out, and is on the edge of the island. The oceans are still polluted, but the water levels are still relatively low, and the player is free to move about the entire island. <br />
• As the game progresses, the rising water levels start to submerge large parts of the island, making it unsuitable for shelter. <br />
• Due to the shrinking landmass, the player is forced further and further inland, towards the higher ground, in search of shelter. The player is still expected to meet their food needs, despite the dwindling resources. <br />
• While the island gets submerged, the safe zone continues to shrink as well, forcing the player to balance the safe zone and water level to navigate through the area <br /><br />
The world is not the only threat that the player must face. There are several polar bears roaming the world which will chase and attack the player on sight. Survival is not easy, and the player can often find other penguins around the world who failed to survive. This helps add an emotional impact to the game and gives the player a sense of the challenges that the animals face. <br /><br />
The objective is to navigate to the shelter, without succumbing to the hostile, constantly changing environment or the deadly predators roaming the world. The player must rely on the food sources on the island, but not all the food available is safe to consume and the player must weigh these choices when looking for food. <br />
